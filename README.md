# game-Worms-nima

### Project description: 

In this Project I am creating a kind of "Worms" game, which has a more fantasy like look.
At the beginning all characters, platforms, props, etc. are modelled in Maya. Later on, all the models
are imported into Unity where I build and program the game itself.
In the end it should be a game where two players can play on one PC and fight against each other by shooting projectiles. 
The player whose health bar is empty first, is the loser.
